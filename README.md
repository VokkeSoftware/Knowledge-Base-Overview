# Vokke's Knowledge Base

Welcome to Vokke's Knowledge Base. 

This is an overview of what the Knowledge Base is and how you can use it

<h2>Overview</h2>

What is a knowledge base? Essentially, it is a central resource where we capture and communicate knowledge.

<h2>Philosophy</h2>
Our Knowledge Base is:

<ul>
<li>A living, breathing resource</li>
<li>Open to all team members to contribute to</li>
<li>Simple and easy to navigate</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using the Knowledge Base</h2>
Resources are stored in repositories. Each repository relates to a particular skill or a general topic. For example, we have a repository dedicated to software development processes and another one for company-wide processes (Team PlaybooK).

<h2>What belongs in the Knowledge Base</h2>
Standards, guidelines and processes that document how things are done at Vokke.

<h2>Contributing to the Knowledge Base</h2>
To ensure that valuable content is created, the following standards should be followed when developing a resource for the KB.

<h3>Naming conventions</h3>
Our GitHub account is also used as part of our development process so to ensure that anything related to our Knowledge Base can be easily located in the future or by other users, the following naming convention must be followed:

Repository title= "Knowledge-Base-<i>Title</i>"


Language should be clear and concise

<h2>Wiki</h2>
How to use the wiki feature

<h2>Slack integration</h2>
We can integrate Slack with the Knowledge Base so the team gets real-time updates when questions are asked or answered.
